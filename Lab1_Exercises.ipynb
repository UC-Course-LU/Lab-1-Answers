We assume prior familiarity with numpy and matplotlib. The material in this lab serves as an important basis for your assignments. Therefore, make sure to familiarize yourself with them before the first assignment is due.

The difference with Python lists is much more profound. A Python list is allowed to contain any kind of object - floating point numbers, integers, strings, sub-lists, sets, dictionaries, class instances, whole classes, functions, and packages. Clearly, those different kinds of things don't all need the same kind of memory, so they can't be stored in a neat row of equal-size chunks in memory. When you decide to referce item 10 of a list, Python has to look up where item 10 is stored. Meanwhile, a Numpy array is strictly homogenous in its data type - it's all float64, or all integer32 and so forth. Each cell in the array is the same size, so if you know where the array starts, you can easily calculate where each value is. (There is more to it, but this is the key point: Numpy arrays are homogenously typed and that enables optimization tricks.)"

        "You'll also notice that this plot uses a lot of calls on the `ax` object and a few on `fig`, but not a lot of calls to `plt`. In a lot of tutorials you'll see most of the same code, but all calls made to `plt`. Why is that?\n",
        "\n",
        "Basically, Matplotlib got started as a port of MATLAB plotting capabilities to Python. `plt` is basically a placeholder that points to the most recent figure you were working on. That's fine as long as you're only working on one plot in a project, but it can become confusing if you're generating a lot of pictures.\n",
        "\n",
        "What we do when we call `fig, ax = plt.subplots()` is generate a new *Figure* with in this case one *Axes* object. The Axes object is what we think of as the actual plot: it has an X and Y axis (hence the name, axes, plural of axis), and it's where we're drawing on. The Figure is more like the windowframe around it. We can have a Figure with multiple Axes in it, which is what happens if you call [plt.subplots](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html) with arguments to indicate how many you'd like; then instead of a single Axes object, you get a bunch of them.  For a more extensive tutorial of \"best practices\" Matplotlib, I recommend [Python Plotting With Matplotlib (Guide)](https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/) and [Effectively Using Matplotlib](https://pbpython.com/effective-matplotlib.html)."
